Research Statement
======
I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Statistics and Computer Science at Michigan State University, co-advised by Prof. Jiliang Tang and Prof. Yuying Xie and currently a visiting researcher at Stanford University with Prof. Xiaojie Qiu. My research develops foundation models at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology. I build methods that capture cross-scale biological patterns—from genes and cells to tissues and organs—to advance our understanding of development and disease mechanisms.

Education
======
* Ph.D., Statistics and Computer Science, Michigan State University (09/2021 -- 05/2026, expected)
* B.S., Statistics, University of Science and Technology of China (09/2017 -- 06/2021)

Experiences
======
* **Stanford University**, Visiting Researcher — Advisor: Xiaojie Qiu (06/2024 -- Present)
  * Develop multiscale foundation models of mouse embryogenesis that integrate single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data for _in silico_ perturbation studies.
  * Apply neural ordinary differential equations to capture temporal dynamics in embryonic development with interpretable biological insights.
  * Contribute to the PantheonOS platform, automating scalable analysis of single-cell and spatial genomics data.
* **Michigan State University**, Research Assistant — Advisors: Yuying Xie, Jiliang Tang (09/2022 -- Present)
  * Apply graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models to single-cell analysis; scMoFormer helped Team DANCE earn a Kaggle silver medal in multimodal data integration.
  * Co-develop the DANCE toolkit that standardizes preprocessing, benchmarking, and end-to-end workflows for key biological tasks.
  * Pretrain large-scale single-cell foundation models that unify single-cell and spatial data and investigate graph foundation models and diffusion-based pretraining.
* **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University**, Research Assistant — Advisor: Wenqi Fan (05/2023 -- 08/2023)
  * Reformulate biological inference problems such as perturbation prediction as posterior estimation using diffusion-based generative models.
  * Study synergies between large language models and graph machine learning for biological representation learning.
