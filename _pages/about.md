I am a final-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.msu.edu/) and [Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University, advised by Prof. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/) and Prof. [Yuying Xie](https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/Directory/Profiles/Person/101084?org=44&group=145). I am currently a visiting researcher at Stanford University working with Prof. [Xiaojie Qiu](https://www.devo-evo.com/). My research develops foundation models that bridge artificial intelligence and biology, capturing patterns that connect genes, cells, tissues, and organs to better understand development and disease.

I received my B.S. in [Statistics](https://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm) from the University of Science and Technology of China.

You can download my CV [here]({{ '/files/WenzhuoTang_CV.pdf' | relative_url }}).
